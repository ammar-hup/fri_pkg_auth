# Architecture Spine — auth

## Design Paradigm

A standalone Python library in `src/` layout, published from `pyproject.toml` and consumed by the services as a pinned dependency. It has no runtime of its own: everything here is imported, so a breaking change is felt at every consumer's next pin and nowhere earlier.

## Inherited Invariants

These are the estate's, listed by their original ids and **not** re-keyed here — a second key
for one decision is the collision the namespace grammar exists to prevent. Where anything below
disagrees with one of these, the inherited decision wins and the disagreement is a conflict to
surface, not a local override.

- `estate:AD-1` — the knowledge base is a routing aid, never the authority
- `estate:AD-2` — a decision lives in the repo it binds
- `estate:AD-3` — every citation is namespaced
- `estate:AD-4` — board automation never moves a card between lists
- `estate:AD-5` — human requests enter through a separate board, and only through triage
- `estate:AD-6` — courses is the system of record for live cohorts
- `estate:AD-7` — one NATS subject grammar: `<service>.<aggregate_type>`, event variant in the payload
- `estate:AD-8` — two ACL database roles: SELECT-only at runtime, write-capable only at deploy

## Invariants & Rules

None yet. This spine was scaffolded on 2026-08-28 as a container only: nothing has been ruled for
the `auth` namespace, and an invariant invented at scaffold time is a guess wearing a
citation. Numbering starts at one when the first decision is actually made, and is never reused
or renumbered after that.

## Deferred

Not yet enumerated. The gaps this repo knows it owes are recorded here as they are noticed —
a named gap is worth more than silence, because it stops the next reader concluding the
question was never asked.
